Lightstone
==========

Introduction
------------

Lightstone is an open-source implementation of the
[Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) server software written in Java.

The official server software has some shortcomings such as the use of threaded,
synchronous I/O along with high CPU and RAM usage. Lightstone aims to be a
lightweight and high-performance alternative.

Building
--------

Lightstone can be built with the
[Java Development Kit](http://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) and
[Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org). [Apache Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy) is
also used for dependency management.

If you have not yet done so, you will need to download the project's
dependencies which can be done with the `ant resolve` command. This only needs
to be done once initially and when the dependencies are updated.

Typing the command `ant` in the terminal will build the project.

Running
-------

Although not recommended, the server can be started via Ant. This is useful
for certain IDEs e.g. NetBeans which require an Ant target to run the project.

Typing the command `ant run` in the terminal will do this. It will also build
the project if the binaries are out of date.

Documentation
-------------

Javadocs can be generated by using the `ant doc` command in the terminal.
